# TFSWorkITemExporter
TFS Work Items Exporter Tool This tool helps the user to export the items into html pages structure, the attachments are included, and work item history comments are also added.

Once you run the tool, enter your domain name and user/password, and enter the local TFS server URL. Then you will be able to query the work items and export them easily.

(if you have fiddler installed on your machine it might cause you some problems if the tool is running and fiddler not! attachment fails to download.. am not sure why .. I might fix it in future :) )

The source code is here, you can use it and edit it as you like. Please keep the about author comments.

Note: It has been tested with on premises TFS, am not sure if the same code can be edited to work with online Team Services but I think that would require a different approach.
